# Code Review
* by Neil Routley

## Like
* the website looks great and you have a lot of the key functionality working, i.e., maps, registration, and events.  
* you have a very clean structure to your application with concerns all separated
* the dog markers on the map are SUPER CUTE.  

## Problems
* once you login, if you use the BORQForceOne nav logo/title, you have no way to get back to where you were other than re-logging into the site.  
* there is no way to match the events on the map to the events listed.  a bit confusing.


### Over all
* project is a really great idea and I know if you have a little more time you could easily implement enough functionally to make the site complete. great job!
